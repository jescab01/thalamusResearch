# Color blindness

There are ways of avoiding color blindness issues in your figures. Most of colorblind people suffer from
Deuteranomaly (Deuteranopia o daltonismo). There are web-pages that explains how is their color perception:

- https://towardsdatascience.com/two-simple-steps-to-create-colorblind-friendly-data-visualizations-2ed781a167ec

And there, you can find webpages that help you creating color-palettes that are friendly to colorblind people:

- https://coolors.co/

What I eventually have found is that the proposed colors are not very different from the ones already used
in plotly. Maybe the point is that I dont have to notice it, because I dont have the problem.
